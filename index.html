        <h3>
Schoolpol &mdash; breaking new ground in the study of education and advanced political economies</h3>

        <p>The <strong>educational context</strong> that children are born into
          dramatically shapes their life chances, affecting not only their
          <strong>future economic well-being</strong>, but also their propensity to
          <strong>participate in civic and political life</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Schoolpol research examines the link between <strong>varying cohort
            educational experiences</strong> and <strong>social mobility and political
            participation</strong>. </p>

        <p>
         We ask three major questions:
         <ol>
           <li>How and why do formal educational structures vary?</li>
           <li>How and why do regional educational structures vary?</li>
           <li>How does this variation affect political behaviours of those educated in varying systems?</li>
         </ol>
        </p>
        <p>To investigate these questions, this project has created <strong>the
            first systematic database of educational policy</strong> from <strong>1945&ndash;2015</strong>
          and <strong>regional educational performance</strong> from <strong>1980&ndash;2015</strong>, across a
          group of selected democracies.</p>
